Eglish Version:

Dear employee,

OMG, last month you earned RMB {总收入} yuan, congrats!

But tax is {税} Yuan, therefore you only received {净收入} Yuan [sad face]

Be grateful, since tax for interns is much higher in Google.

All in all, thank you for your devotion and hardworking, and I am your father.

Best Regards,

H(ighness) R(oyal)
